2 sticks cold salted butter, chopped into cubes
330g sugar 
12-15g molasses, 
2 large eggs
2 tsp vanilla
475g AP flour
40g corn starch
1 tsp baking soda 4.5g
1 tsp baking powder 4.5g
2 tsp coarse salt 11.5
260g chocolate chips 

Cream the butter and both sugars, then add vanilla and eggs one at a time until fully incorporated. 
Whisk together the dry ingredients, add to the creamed mixture and mix on low until the flour just disappears. 
Mix in the chocolate with just a few pulses then cover and put in the fridge while oven preheats (doesn't need to be as long as regular cookies).

Preheat 375 fan (400 if you don't have convection baking). 

1450g total dough, select cookie size from below:
100g makes 14 and is what you should do
75g makes 19
65g makes 22
45g makes 32
30g makes 48 (these are cutest)

Bake for 8-11 minutes depending on size, until the cookie is barely set and starts to turn light golden on top. 
Will appear under baked but that's what you're looking for.
