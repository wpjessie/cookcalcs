2 sticks cold unsalted butter, chopped into cubes
255g light brown sugar (2.5%, 248g + 7g molasses)
90g granulated sugar
2 large eggs, chicken-style
2tsp vanilla (optional?)
475g AP flour
40g corn starch
1tsp baking soda
1tsp baking powder
2tsp coarse salt
250g chocolate chips 

Cream the butter and both sugars, then add vanilla and eggs one at a time until fully incorporated. 
Whisk together the dry ingredients, add to the creamed mixture and mix on low until the flour just disappears. 
Mix in the chocolate with just a few pulses then cover and put in the fridge for (doesn't need to be as long as regular cookies).

Preheat 375 fan (400 if you don't have convection baking). 

1350g total dough, decide cookie size from below:
75g cookies makes 18 total
65g makes 20
45g makes 30
30g makes 45 (these are cutest)

Bake for 9-10 minutes, until the cookie is barely set and starts to turn light golden on top. 
Will appear under baked but that's what you're looking for.
