240g unsalted butter, cut into bits (1 cup)
255g light brown sugar (1 1/4 cup)
  (2.5% molasses 248g + 7g molasses)
90g granulated sugar (1/2 cup)
2 large eggs, cold
Vanilla?
385g of AP flour (2 3/4 cup)
40g corn starch (1/4 cup)
115g rolled oats (1 1/2 cups)
1 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp coarse salt
1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
Dash nutmeg
//1206g total so far//
265g raisins

Cream the butter and both sugars on low, then add eggs one at a time until fully incorporated. Whisk together the dry ingredients, add to the creamed mixture and mix on low until the flour just disappears. Mix in the raisins/chocolate with just a few pules then cover and put in the fridge for an hour or two (doesn't need to be as long as regular cookies).

Preheat 400 fan (425 if you don't have convection baking). Gently make balls of 100g (careful not to pack too tightly, just enough to hold together as it bakes)

Bake for 9 minutes, until the cookie is barely set and starts to turn golden on top. They'll seem undercooked, but that's what you're after.

You can eat them right away but should let cool for an hour or two to get the right texture. Otherwise they'll seem a bit too gooey.
